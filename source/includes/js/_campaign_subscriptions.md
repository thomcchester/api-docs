# Campaign Subscriptions

## Subscribe to a Campaign

> Example request

```javascript
_dcq.push(["subscribe", { campaign_id: "9999999", fields: { email: "john@acme.com" }}]);
```

This method will add a subscriber directly to campaign. If you would like to add a subscriber to your account without subscribing them to a campaign, use an <a href="#identifying-visitors">identify call</a> instead.
