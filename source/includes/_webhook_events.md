# Webhook Events

[Webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) allow you to
receive an HTTP POST to the URL(s) of your choosing anytime certain events occur
in your Drip account. All our webhook events contain data serialized as JSON.
If you'd like to be notified (with data) everytime a visitor subscribes,
you'll want to use webhooks.

## Setting Up

Adding a webhook URL is dead simple. Head over the [Webhooks](https://www.getdrip.com/webhooks)
settings page, enter your URL, and hit "Create Webhook". That's it!

Because of the potential for high volume, we will not send notifications for
`subscriber.received_email` events by default. To receive a post every time a subscriber
receives and email, enable these events using the checkbox on the webhook's settings.

Please note that some webhook endpoints may implement rate limiting, especially for entry-level or free accounts.
We will attempt to re-send webhooks for up to 3 days if they are rate limited.
In addition, you will be notified and your webhook will be temporarily disabled if its endpoint generates any other error for 3 days.
